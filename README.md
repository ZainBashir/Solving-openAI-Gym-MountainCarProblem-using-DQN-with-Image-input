# Solving-openAI-Gym-MountainCarProblem-using-DQN-with-Image-input
I have targeted to solve the a benchmark problem in Reinforcement learning literature using Deep Q-networks with images as the only input to the model. Keras was used to model the Convolutional neural network which predicts the best action to take in a given state
